# PROJECT TIMELINE


## Meetings
* We formed group chats to coordinate and determine the meeting time. We conducted our weekly meetings either during the lab section, after class, or through Zoom and phone calls.
* During our initial meeting, we had a discussion about the project topics and created a detailed whole project timeline. We worked together diligently, regularly exchanging project updates, brainstorming ideas, and actively troubleshooting issues. 

## Assignment 1 _ Proposal
* Each team member contributed two ideas, resulting in a total of ten proposals. After deliberation, we narrowed down our focus to health and the environment, leading to the final selection of four ideas:
  1) Weather and Crime Tracker
  2) Travel Planner with Weather Integration
  3) Healthier You, Healthier Food Choice
  4) Real-time Environmental Condition & Personalized Health Advice.
     
* We ultimately selected two ideas for our project: 1) Travel Planner with Weather Integration and 2) A Health and Environment Monitoring App.Our final project choices were determined through a voting process, and we selected the first idea (Travel Planner with Weather Integration.
* More information about these ideas can be found on our GitHub repository: [https://github.com/HyunjiKim-creator/CS411_TEAM7/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/HyunjiKim-creator/CS411_TEAM7/blob/main/README.md). 


## Assignment 2 _ User Stories
* Each group member contributed one user story for the "Travel Planner with Weather Integration" project (Five in total). During the meeting, we engaged in a thorough discussion and proofreading session to ensure that the five user stories were aligned in terms of functionality. We provided each other with advice and feedback to refine them. 
* The details of these five user stories can be found on our GitHub repository: [https://github.com/HyunjiKim-creator/CS411_TEAM7/tree/main/Assignments/User%20Stories](https://github.com/HyunjiKim-creator/CS411_TEAM7/tree/main/Assignments/User%20Stories).


## Assigment 3 _ API Prototype

* ### Application Objective
The primary objective of this application is to provide a personalized, convenient, and efficient tral planning experience. By integrating Google’s OAuth 2.0(not implemented yet) for user authentication, the application ensures security and simplicity for the user during login. Also, by fetching relevant weather and location data based on the user’s input(location, date, preferences) the application offers personalized information. This data is saved to user info, and displayed. This simplifies travel planning by centralizing essential information, enhancing the overall experience. 

* ### Back - end Framework

**Flask**
We chose Flash because it has excellent documentation, which makes it easier to understand the concepts and the features. Also it provides a simple and intuitive API that allows us to quickly get started with building web applications.

**Postman**
We chose Postman because it allows developers to testing and develop the APIs efficiently. It provides a user friendly interface for making HTTP requests and responses. It also features a collaboration system, which enables teams to share codes and work on API project together.

* ### Front - end Framework

**HTML**
We can add various, convenient UI features with html. We can design and make our application look better and make it more accessible for our users.
  
* ### Data Format

**JSON**
We chose JSON because it’s a good choice for moving data back and forth between the front end and the back end. JSON creates a class of programmers that could move fluidly across the entire stack. Since we are using HTML, when an HTML form POSTs a JSON string, and the database uses JSON natively, there are no transformations needed.

* ### Dynamic Interaction and Data Fetching
  
**JavaScript**
We used JavaScript to interact with the webpage elements, handle button click events, and fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
jQuery: We used jQuery library to simplify HTML documental traversal, event handling, and Ajax interactions.
Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML): We used Ajax for fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API without refreshing the page.

* ### APIs
**1) OpenWeatherMap API** which provides weather data, including current weather data, and forecasts to the developers of web services.

**2) Google Map** which integrates a vast database of points of interest (POIs) like restaurants, hotels, and attractions. This enables the app to offer users nearby POIs based on their location.

**3) Geocoding** which converts addresses like a street address into geographic coordinates.

## Assignment 4 _ Finish Application & Document
Our team meets in person every day to collaborate and work together towards the finalization of the application and UI/UX designs. With face-to-face interaction and open communication, we were able to refine varuous aspect of the project, ensuring its optimal quality and functionality.We acknowledge that there are still deficiencies in the project that require attention and improvement. Howver, please consider that our team has made concerted efforts to address these issues and find suitable solutions.For a detailed understanding of our work process and the comprehensive outcomes, we encourage you to explore the details provided in the document accessible through the following link: [Final Document](https://github.com/HyunjiKim-creator/CS411_TEAM7/blob/main/docs/Assignment%204_%20Final%20Document.docx).
